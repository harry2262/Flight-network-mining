# Real-Time Flight Analysis with Apache Spark GraphX

This project leverages Apache Spark and GraphFrames to analyze flight data through graph-based computations. By processing data from a CSV file, it applies algorithms like PageRank and Connected Components to:

- Identify key airports
- Reveal patterns in flight routes
- Uncover hidden connections within the network

These analyses provide insights into the connectivity, traffic flow, and overall structure of the flight network. The results are visualized, offering a comprehensive understanding of the aviation industry's underlying graph dynamics.
